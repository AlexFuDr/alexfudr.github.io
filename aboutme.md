subtitle: Path to an Acupuncturist
---

Hello, my name is Alex Fu, and my journey into the world of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been nothing short of transformative. As an acupuncturist, my goal is not only to heal but also to educate—to share the profound wisdom of acupuncture and help people understand its potential to restore balance and promote wellness. I believe in the power of acupuncture to bridge ancient healing traditions with modern lives, and I am passionate about making this belief more accessible to everyone.

### My story
Growing up, I was always fascinated by the way the human body could heal itself. Watching my grandparents use herbal remedies and acupuncture to address everyday ailments sparked an early curiosity. I wanted to understand this ancient wisdom and how it could harmonize with modern medicine to help people live healthier lives.

That curiosity became a calling, and I pursued my Bachelor’s degree at Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, followed by a Master’s degree at Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. These years were not just about learning techniques but about immersing myself in the philosophy of TCM—the idea of treating the person, not just the symptoms.
### Specialties
Over the past eight years, I’ve had the privilege of practicing acupuncture and TCM, specializing in areas close to my heart:

 - Digestive Health: Conditions like atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and inflammatory bowel disease often bring patients to me. I’ve seen how acupuncture, combined with herbal medicine, can restore balance and provide relief from chronic discomfort.
 - Women’s Health: Helping women navigate infertility has been one of the most rewarding aspects of my career. Combining acupuncture with carefully chosen herbal therapies, I aim to support their journeys to parenthood.
 - Pediatrics: Children’s health holds a special place in my practice. From managing indigestion to easing allergic rhinitis and childhood asthma, I strive to help little ones thrive.

Every patient’s story is unique, and I believe deeply in tailoring treatments to address the root causes of their conditions. This personalized approach not only alleviates immediate concerns but also fosters long-term healing and wellness.

This journey has been one of growth, learning, and connection. I am continually inspired by the resilience of the human body and spirit, and I remain committed to helping my patients find balance and harmony in their lives.
